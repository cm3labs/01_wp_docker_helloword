# 01_wp_docker_helloword
My first time trying a docker instance of WordPress

2024-12-11 14:06 - cloned from repo, making a change, add, first commit
2024-12-11 14:13 - added .env, added Dockerfile, add/commit to test
2024-12-11 14:22 - not sure why, but .env file was uploaded, removing it
2024-12-11 13:50 - trying the .env with a .gitignore this time ...
